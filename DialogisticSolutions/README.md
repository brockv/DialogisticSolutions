## Float:None; Project ##
The project that Float:None; has taken on for our senior project is the creation of **Dialogistic**. This web application will help facilitate Phone-A-Thon management.

### Vision Statement ###
>For fundraisers who need phone-a-thon donor data organization and scheduling, Dialogistic is a data management system that will assist in the managing of a phone-a-thon, displaying information on past constituents and potential constituents. It will also allow volunteer fundraisers to be assigned people to call and allow them to submit changes to data records which will be reviewed and approved by an administrator. Unlike the current manual google document process for handling this information and call assignment, our product will allow for CSV importing/exporting and will algorithmically assign calls to volunteers based on history.
