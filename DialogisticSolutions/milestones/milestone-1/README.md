# Milestone 1 #

## Overview ##
This milestone will get your team organized and begin the process of working together as a group. Don't underestimate the difficulty of doing simple things as a group. Communicate, communicate, communicate!

In step 6 you will create a Git repository for your team. This is where all the documents created during each Milestone should be placed (neatly and in appropriate folders). A note on file formats: you should default to plain text files for everything. The resumes (e.g. Word) and logos, etc. (e.g. png) can and should be in the appropriate formats, but if you're only writing text, put it in a Plain Old Text file. Of course, html and Markdown are plain text and also give you formatting options if you so desire.

The 3+branch, with Pull Requests Git Workflow that we'll be using all term isn't introduced until Milestone 2. For now you can either learn the workflow ahead of time, or do the less-than-desired method of manually transferring files to the repo owner, who should add/commit/push them. Under no circumstances should all team members have admin or write access to the team repository. That's a great way to screw up your repo. Last term we all had our own repositories and could control the entire push/pull cycles. Imagine 4 people randomly adding, committing, pushing and pulling!
