# Sprint 2 Retrospective #
Held on: February 5, 2019

Our group met and ran our safety check. We all feel very confident in sharing things with ours, and our current Safety check is at a 4.75 average. As a team, we did a lot of learning through this first sprint, which bled into what was and was not going right.

We learned that we need to start on our tasks or user stories earlier, giving us more time to test near the end of the sprint. We also want to check on each other's work to make sure we are all in full understanding in what the other is doing. We also learned the importance of the `.mdf` file and the `<connectionString>`. We learned, through trial and error, that we need to constantly be double-checking that those files are non-existant in our code. In the future, we would like to automate this process.

Looking forward, we want to communicate better throughout the week, having metings multiple times each week either in-person or over voice-chat. Our Action Plan is as follows:

We did not find any items that needed to be brought up with someone outside of the team, and we feel very confident in the direction we are heading.
