# Milestone 2 #

## Overview ##
This week we begin with one week of Inception on a class project. It's a dummy or throw-away project that we can all go through together to make sure we're doing things right. After that your team will do a second run-through on your 3 project ideas. Finally you'll do some practice with Git on the workflow you'll use this term. I say finally, but you should do this first and use this workflow for all documents you produce this week (and here on out).
