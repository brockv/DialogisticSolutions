# Sprint 1 Retrospective #
**Held on:** February 24, 2019

Our group met via a voice chat to discuss our past sprint (Sprint 1) and the upcoming sprint.

We realized that the items we addressed at our retrospective for the pratice project need to be implemented into these sprints better. We learned that we need to be giving ourselves enough time to test all of our features better, as well as much testing of the deployed site. We did much better at removing our `<connectionString>` and `.mdf` files when creating our pull requests.

Looking forward, we want to communicate more frequently about the status of our features, as well as any issues to which we may be confronting. That allows for each of us to assist each other in solving problems. We will continue to communicate more frequently over our voice-chat.

We did not find any items that needed to be brought up with someone outside of the team, and we feel very confident in the direction we are heading.
